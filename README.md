# UFOs
## Overview
Our project this week involves working with Dana on creating a dynamic webiste that can provide an indepth analysis of UFO sightings. In order to do this, we expending on the original website created during the modudes but adding filters for Cities, States, Countries, and the shape of the spotted UFO. This can allow users to pin point extactly what they are looking for or, can allow them to discover sightings based off certain perameters not related to the date.
## Results
As seen in the image below, now there are multiple options for what you can search the data base by.

For example, if you are looking for a specific UFO sighting that you remembered from the local news, you can search based off of the date but also provide the city that you are looking for. If you want to search just based off of the shape, you can do that as well. Maybe you are writing a research paper and want to compare the trends of where different shaped UFOs are appearing. With our new website, you can now do that too. Below are two screenshot showing both of the described searches from above. 
## Summary
At the end of the day, this website is more detailed than it originally was. One drawback on this, however, is that we cannot search by duration. Considering that this is a data point in the data, it would make sense that we could search that as well. A future update to the webiste should include this as a filter option. Another recommendation would be to add the ability for the user to adjust the website to run in dark mode or regular. I am not exaclty sure what the code would look like to do that but, a simple button could be programmed to execute the function.
